Jabberwocky
By Lewis Carroll

’Twas brillig, and the ſlithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimſy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe.

“Beware the Jabberwock, my ſon!
      The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and ſhun
      The frumious Banderſnatch!”

He took his vorpal ſword in hand;
      Long time the manxome foe he ſought—
So reſted he by the Tumtum tree
      And ſtood awhile in thought.

And, as in uffiſh thought he ſtood,
      The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
      And burbled as it came!

One, two! One, two! And through and through
      The vorpal blade went ſnicker-ſnack!
He left it dead, and with its head
      He went galumphing back.

“And haſt thou ſlain the Jabberwock?
      Come to my arms, my beamiſh boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”
      He chortled in his joy.

’Twas brillig, and the ſlithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimſy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe.
