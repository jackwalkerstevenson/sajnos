Replaces 's' characters with long s 'ſ' according to the 18th-century rules described on Wikipedia.

Replace s with ſ except:

- always round s at the end of a word (except abbreviations, but not handling this)
- always round s before an apostrophe within a word (that is, an apostrophe followed by a letter)
- always round s adjacent to f
